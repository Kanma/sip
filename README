This is a custom distribution of SIP version 4.12.1, a tool that makes it very easy to
create Python bindings for C and C++ libraries.

This distribution includes a custom CMake-based build system tailored to fit in
my other projects.


License
-------

SIP's license is unchanged. SIP is available under the following licenses:

    * SIP License. This is very similar to the Python Software Foundation license used
      for Python itself (see LICENSE)
    * GNU General Public License v2 (see LICENSE-GPL2)
    * GNU General Public License v3 (see LICENSE-GPL3)


Submodules
----------

This distribution optionally use XMake as a GIT submodules. My other projects use this
system to easily compile all their dependencies.

To download it, do:

	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update


Configuration
-------------

Before compiling this project, it will be configured using the Python interpreter you
want to create modules for. By default, the command 'python' is used. If you want to
use another instance of Python on your system, change the value of the setting
SIP_PYTHON_INTERPRETER (by using ccmake for instance, or directly on the command line
using the -D notation).


Compilation
-----------

It is recommended to compile SIP in a separate folder. Here's how I do it:

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
